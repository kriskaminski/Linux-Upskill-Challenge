title: Day 1 - Accessing your server
---

## INTRO
### You should now have a remote server setup running the latest Ubuntu Server LTS (Long Term Support) version. You alone will be administering it. To become a fully-rounded Linux server admin you should become comfortable working with different versions of Linux, but for now Ubuntu is a good choice.
### Once you have reached a level of comfort at the command-line then you'll find your skills transfer not only to all the standard Linux variants, but also to Android, Apple's OSX, OpenBSD, Solaris and IBM AIX. Throughout the course you'll be working on Linux - but in fact most of what is covered is applicable to any system in the "UNIX family" - and the major differences between them are with their graphic user interfaces such as Gnome, Unity, KDE etc - none of which youâ€™ll be using!
### Although there is a "root" user, you will be logging in and working from the user account that you setup. Because this is a member of the group "sudo" it is able to run commands "as root" by preceding them with "sudo".
